# Adjustments
This filter was created with the objective to be a general filter that works for everybody and throughout the entire game, so it possibly needs some adjustments to fit your game style. To facilitate the editing, everything should be done through [Filtration](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1287447/).

## Filtration
[Filtration](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1287447/) is a program of filter editing with a graphical interface, that means you don't have to work with lines of code, only clicks of buttons. This filter supports [Filtration](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1287447/), so you should see many sections, blocks and themes to make the editing easier.

## Adjustable Sections
Obviously, you can edit basically everything in the filter, but some section need attention since they are only useful if you want them to be:

* Craft
* Life Flasks
* Mana Flasks
* Utility Flasks
* Chance Uniques
