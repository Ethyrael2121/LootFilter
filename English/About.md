# About this Filter
The goal of this filter is to remove all unnecessary junk from the screen and highlight the important things you must pickup. The filter uses all filter features to improve your Path of Exile experience, but it uses border coloring the most. The reason for that is to keep it simple and not to turn PoE into a rainbow party.
