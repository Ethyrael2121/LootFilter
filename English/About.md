# About this Filter
The goal of this filter is to remove all unnecessary junk from the screen and highlight the important things you must pickup. The filter uses all filter features to improve your Path of Exile experience, but it uses border coloring the most. The reason for that is to keep it simple and not to turn PoE into a rainbow party.

#Usage Suggestion
The best way to use the filter, in my opinion, is to use the **Use Bound Key** option in the Key Pickup at the UI tab on the Option menu. And using another key to highlight items on the ground. I use **Alt** as Item pickup key and **F** as Highlight items and objects. With that you pick up visible items using the Alt key and if you want to see invisible items, you use the F key.
